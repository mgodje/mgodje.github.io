        Hi, I'm Maryann Godje! I'm a current student at UC Santa Cruz studying Computer Science. 
        I'm passionate about VR/AR/XR, Human-Computer Interaction, computer graphics and vision, game development, and web development. 
        I'm interested in research to help improve user experiences and make technology more accessible to everyone.
        My next steps are achieving a Masters of Science in Computer Science and applying for internships opportunities! ðŸ˜Š
