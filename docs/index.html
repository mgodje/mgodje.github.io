            Hi, I'm Maryann Godje! I'm a current student at UC Santa Cruz
            studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about VR/AR/XR,
            Human-Computer Interaction, computer graphics and vision, game
            development, and web development. I'm interested in research to help
            improve user experiences and make technology more accessible to
            everyone. My next steps are achieving a Masters of Science in
            Computer Science and applying for internship opportunities! ðŸ˜Š

            This project is a multi-user VR experience that aided marine
            biologists to visually analyze northern elephant seal paths in
            around Monterey, CA. The goal is to visually see the paths the seals
            took, the depths they went, and at what points were they asleep
            during their dives in migration. My contributions to this project
            included frontend and backend developments to create raycasting
            modalities that were allocentric, meaning that all users in the VR
            space could see the same information. An example of this is a
            feature where users can mark places of interest along seal paths.
            Once a user marks a place, all users can see their marker. I also
            helped develop the scaling, sizing, and depth of the seals' paths
            using mathematical concepts for 3D visualization purposes.

            Like the Northern Elephant Seal Migration project, it is a
            multi-user VR experience that aided civil engineers to problem solve
            the unfortunate traffic situation that occurred during wildfire
            evacuation in Iverness, CA. The goal is to find better roads to
            redirect citizens to. This way, first responders are able to reach
            the fire in time to put it out. My contributions to this project
            included developing raycasting and calloutable features in the
            frontend, which allow users to hover, click, and display the
            information of cars and roads in VR. I also networked in the backend
            to make sure these features were more allocentric. This allows all
            users in the VR space to see a user's pop-ups instead of just the
            person who selected the pop-up.

            This project was developed in Dr. Daniel Shapiro's CMPM 146 Game AI
            class, which I took in Summer of 2024. I worked in a team of 4 to
            develop an AI Visual Novel game where the user can tell the AI to
            generate any story they wanted. The LLM model, then, creates a
            storyline with a climax and resolution, as well as displays images
            relevant to each scene. The player gets 5 options after each scene:
            4 AI-generated options or a "write your own" selection where the
            player can change the trajectory of the story. My contributions
            included developing the frontend and web development features with
            Three.js to give a more mystical feel to the game. I explored the
            great possibilities of HTML by creating several webpages (homepage,
            game selection page, game start page, etc.) to enhance user
            experience. I learned how to effectively brainstorm ideas and
            communicate with my team members to produce a high-quality prototype
            for a game.
